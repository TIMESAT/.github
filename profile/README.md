# TIMESAT Official GitHub

Welcome to the **official GitHub organization for TIMESAT**.  
This is the **only official repository hub** for the TIMESAT software and related resources.

## About TIMESAT
TIMESAT is a software package for analysing time-series of satellite sensor data. We have developed TIMESAT to be able to investigate the seasonality of satellite time-series data and their relationship with dynamic properties of vegetation, such as phenology and temporal development. The temporal domain holds important information about short- and long-term vegetation changes. The first generation of TIMESAT - distributed as version 3, was limited to processing of data with a regular time step, typical of data from MODIS or NOAA AVHRR. This version is very stable and is still distributed at the timesat webpage, see Contact. The new generation, named TIMESAT version 4 and distributed in this repository, is built on the same principles but works with irregularly spaced data in time (Sentinel-2, Landsat etc.) and has several incremental modifications and improvements. TIMESAT 4 is the basis of several operational products, e.g. Copernicus CLMS phenology data for Europe from Sentinel-2 data ([HR-VPP](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/copernicus-services-catalogue/high-resolution-vegetation-phenology-and-productivity)) and the globe from Sentinel-3 data (CGLOPS), and projects by ESA ([RAMONA](https://www.ramona.earth/), [SEN4LDN](https://esa-sen4ldn.org/en)).
