Welcome to the **official GitHub organization for TIMESAT**.

## About TIMESAT
TIMESAT is a software package for analysing time-series of satellite sensor data. We have developed TIMESAT to be able to investigate the seasonality of satellite time-series data and their relationship with dynamic properties of vegetation, such as phenology and temporal development. The temporal domain holds important information about short- and long-term vegetation changes.
